/*Challenge
O(n) time and O(1) space
Tag: Enumeration
Thinking process:
Natural thinking process: count how many you have for 1st element, if next one is the same, count++, if next one is not the same, count- -. 
When count ==0, that means other types of element has same amount as the 1st majority number, they are even.
From this point, count the value at current position as the majority number, keep the loop rolling.
Note: this solutions works only when the given array has a valid solution.
CounterCase:[111223], with actually return 3 as the majority number. But again, this is not a valid input in this case.

     * @param nums: a list of integers

    public int majorityNumber(ArrayList<Integer> nums) {
        // write your code

        }
        int candidate = -1;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(count == 0){
                count = 1;
                candidate = nums.get(i);
            }
            else if(candidate == nums.get(i)){//注意这里是else if，一共只有三种情况。if就报错了。如果只写if，
            相当于除了第一个if又进了第二个if.计数会少1.
                count++;
            }
            else{
                count--;
            }
